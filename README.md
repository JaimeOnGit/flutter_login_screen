# A flutter / Firebase login screen

A simple flutter/dart based login-screen that connects with Firebase Auth to enable users to sign-in/up with Email or through Facebook. 

It's created as a template that I can use in upcoming projects instead of having to reinvent the wheel over and over again.  

## Getting Started With This Template

As it's based on Firebase and uses Facebook to login, you'll need the following:

1) A Firebase profile that you can connect through. - Go to Firebase.com and register.
2) To register your app on Facebook - Here's a quick setup guide: https://medium.com/flutterpub/firebase-fb-sign-in-and-flutter-7ab4bdc7172e
